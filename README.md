# Forgeborn

Forgeborn is a 2D atmospheric descent game built in **Godot 4** using **GDScript**.

You play as a small android descending into a vast, dark abyss left behind by the Forgeborn—an ancient civilization that replaced itself with machines in pursuit of immortality. The game focuses on mood, scale, and restraint rather than action or realism.

## Design Focus
- Tiny, pixel-perfect player sprite that remains readable while feeling small on screen
- Very dark environments with visibility centered around the player
- Consistent, restrained color palettes with rare biome-based exceptions
- Ambient sound design and silence as core storytelling tools
- Minimal UI (Health + Charge)
- Player decisions tracked for narrative consequences

## Status
Early development. First vertical slice implemented - see `IMPLEMENTATION.md` for details.

The vertical slice includes:
- Pixel-perfect rendering with tiny player sprite
- Dark ambient lighting with player-centered light
- Basic HUD (Health + Charge)
- Charge drain system
- Biome ambient audio system (Crystal Chasm, placeholder)
- Automatic flag tracking system

## Tech
- Engine: Godot 4
- Language: GDScript
